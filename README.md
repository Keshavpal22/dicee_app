Welcome to Dicee App, my very first Flutter application! 🚀

📱 About the App
This app is a simple yet fun dice roller. When the user taps on the dice, it rolls and displays a new number using Dart's random function. It’s an interactive way to learn how to use functions, random number generation, and asset images in Flutter.

🎯 What I Learned
✅ How to create a basic Flutter UI

✅ Using functions in Dart

✅ Generating random numbers

✅ Adding and displaying images

✅ Building for both iOS and Android

🖼️ Dice Images
Dice face images are included in the project assets and change dynamically based on the random number generated. This helped me learn how to use images in Flutter and set up proper image assets for both platforms.

📦 Platform Support
✅ Android build support

✅ iOS build support
(App icons and launch images are set for both platforms)
